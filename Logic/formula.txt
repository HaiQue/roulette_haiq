Regex to Find
((?:\S+\s+){10})
Replace With
$1\n
Replace All in VS Code.

Full version:
1. Open the Find and Replace Panel
Press Ctrl + H (Windows/Linux) or Cmd + Option + F (macOS)

Make sure the . (Use Regular Expression)* icon is activated (it should be highlighted).

2. Use a Regex Pattern to Insert Line Breaks
Assuming your numbers are separated by spaces, you can search for a pattern that captures 10 space-separated tokens, then replace them with the same 10 tokens followed by a newline.

Regex to Find
css
Copy
((?:\S+\s+){10})
Explanation:

\S+ means “one or more non-whitespace characters” (i.e., a ‘token’ or ‘number’).

\s+ means “one or more whitespace characters” (the space or spaces after each number).

(?: ... ){10} is a non-capturing group repeated exactly 10 times.

We enclose that entire pattern in (( ... )) so we can capture it as group 1 to reuse in our replacement.

Replace With
bash
Copy
$1\n
This means:

$1 → reinsert the same 10 tokens found.

\n → then insert a newline.

3. Run the Replacement
Click Replace All in VS Code.

Every set of 10 space-separated values will be placed on its own line.

4. Post-Replace Adjustments
If you find extra spaces at the start or end of lines, you can run another simple Find/Replace to trim them.

If your data has tabs or different spacing, you can adjust the regex slightly (e.g., use \s+ carefully, or convert tabs to spaces first).

Example
Before (all on one line):

Copy
10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 100 110 120 130 140
After running the replacement:

Copy
10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 100
110 120 130 140
